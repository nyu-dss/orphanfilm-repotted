                                 <p>The success of Orphans 6 was due in large part to the dedication and hard work of Dan Streible's "Curating the Moving Image" class. Being the student blog, we would like to honor the behind-the-scenes efforts of our colleagues. May these short biographies help guide future generations of <em>orphanistas</em> and, in a small way, contribute to even greater success in years to come. </p>

Amongst all this Orphans excitement, he still had time to attend to his student career as a 1st year M.A. in the Cinema Studies program at Tisch School of the Arts.</p>

                                 <p>So we have reached the end of phase one of our blog project. We have dutifully recorded the 6th Orphan Film Symposium in all its enchanting, outlandish, poignant, and joyous moments. Helen Hill’s inspired legacy, Tattoo the indefatigable, and Sam’s camera won’t soon be forgotten. We have learned so much as curators and participants over the past four months that it feels strange to move on. By all accounts, Orphans was a huge success this year even with the significant New York relocation. We are proud to have been part of this momentous occasion, and we hope the blog offers virtual treasures for subsequent students, scholars, and practitioners. The future of this home is in your hands, and we only ask that you treat it as a forum for ideas that innovate, challenge, and edify in the spirit of Orphans! See you in two years…</p>
