                              <p>The success of Orphans 6 was due in large part to the dedication and hard work of Dan Streible's "Curating the Moving Image" class. Being the student blog, we would like to honor the behind-the-scenes efforts of our colleagues. May these short biographies help guide future generations of <em>orphanistas</em> and, in a small way, contribute to even greater success in years to come. </p>

<p>Besides serving as blog editor, writer, and designer extraordinaire, <strong>Wayne Titus</strong> crafted Orphans 6 signage. He sent drafts to the printers and ensured the completion of the final gatorboard (no animals were harmed!) signs posted outside all the venues. He also helped behind the scenes by collating registration packets the day before the event and handing out t-shirts during Wednesday's reception. Amongst all this Orphans excitement, he still had time to attend to his student career as a 1st year M.A. in the Cinema Studies program at Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
